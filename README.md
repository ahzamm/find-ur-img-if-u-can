### Development Setup Guide


Follow these steps to set up the project for development:


1. **Install Dependencies** <br>
Ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed on your machine.
    ```sh
      pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
<br>

2. **Docker Installation** <br>
Install Docker on your machine.

<br>

3. **Run Docker-Compose** <br>
Execute the docker-compose file to set up the project environment. This file defines the services, configurations, and dependencies needed for your project.
    ```sh
      docker-compose up
    ```

<br>

4. **Create Images Directory**
In the root of the project, create an "images" directory to test the code.
    ```sh
      mkdir images
    ```

<br>

**You're Ready to Go** <br>
With the dependencies installed, Docker configured, and the necessary directories set up, you are now ready to start developing your project. Happy coding!
